// 1. Write a dynamic greeter program named greeter.js. The program should ask for your name, then output Hello, {name}! where {name} is the name you entered
let rlSync = require("readline-sync");

// let name = rlSync.question("What is your name?\n");
// console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

// 2. Modify the greeter.js program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet the user with their full name.
let firstName = rlSync.question("What is your first name?\n");
let lastName = rlSync.question("What is your last name?\n")

console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);
