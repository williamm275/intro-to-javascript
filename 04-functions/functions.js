// 1. What does this code log to the console? Does executing the foo function affect the output? Why or why not?
let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);
// The code logs 1 to the console. foo doesn't affect the value assigned to bar on line 1 since JavaScript functions create an inner scope.
